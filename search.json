    "text": "Key Features\n\nDeclarative Layouts: Effortlessly arrange shapes in Row or Column containers with automatic alignment and spacing.\nAnchor System: Connect shapes using semantic anchors like top, bottom, left, right, and center.\nContext Manager Support: Use with statements to group shapes naturally within the code.\nSmart Canvas: Automatically fit the canvas viewport to the content with adjustable padding.\nRich Primitives: Includes Rect, Square, Circle, Ellipse, Line, Arrow, and Path."

    "section": "Quick Start",
    "text": "Quick Start\nThe following example demonstrates how to create two shapes in a row and connect them with an arrow using the anchor system.\n\n\nCode\nfrom tesserax import Canvas, Rect, Arrow, Circle\nfrom tesserax.layout import Row\n\n# Initialize a canvas\nwith Canvas() as canvas:\n    # Arrange a circle and a rectangle in a row with a 50px gap\n    with Row(gap=50):\n        circle = Circle(30, fill=\"#fee\")\n        rect = Rect(100, 60, fill=\"#eef\")\n\n    # Draw an arrow between the two shapes using anchors\n    # .dx() provides a small offset for better visual spacing\n    Arrow(\n        circle.anchor(\"right\").dx(5),\n        rect.anchor(\"left\").dx(-5)\n    )\n\n# Fit the viewport to the shapes and render\ncanvas.fit(padding=10).display()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe display() method in the Canvas class is an IPython/Jupyter/Quarto compatible shortcut to automatically include the rendered SVG (in all its beautiful vectorial glory) directly in a notebook. But you can also use Canvas.save() to generate a plain old, boring SVG file on this, and str(canvas) to get the actual SVG code as a plain string."

    "section": "Core Components",
    "text": "Core Components\nTesserax comes with all basic components you need to draw the spectrum of SVG shapes. All shapes support standard SVG attributes like stroke and fill.\n\nRect & Square: Defined by width/height or a single size.\nCircle & Ellipse: Defined by radii.\nGroups: For grouping shapes and applying transforms to them as a single shape.\nArrow: A specialized line that automatically includes an arrowhead marker.\nPath: Supports a fluent API for complex paths using move_to, line_to, cubic_to, and close.\n\n\nLayouts\nLayouts are a unique feature of Tesserax to automate the positioning of child elements. We currently have three layouts, but these are very easy to extend:\n\nRow: Aligns shapes horizontally. Baselines can be set to start, middle, or end.\nColumn: Aligns shapes vertically with start, middle, or end alignment.\nForceLayout: Typically used to draw graphs."
